<h1>Autonomous Car</h1>
<h2>Description</h2> 
My personal project implemented in Arduino/Python that controls an RC car which drives around a room and collects sonar and infrared sensors data and sends them via Bluetooth to a PC.
PC processes the received data and draws a map of the room based on the data collected. 
Stabilization of driving is done by MPU6050 gyroscope, with courtesy of Romain JL. FETICK's MPU6050_light library.
Distance measurements are done using an encoder attached to a wheel.
